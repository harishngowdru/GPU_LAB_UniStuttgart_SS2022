# GPU_LAB_UniStuttgart_SS2022

Instructions to run this code in Visual Studio

### Environment Configuration:
1. Download NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit from https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
2. Download Boost library from https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.76.0_b1/boost_1_76_0_b1-msvc-14.2-64.exe

### Project Configuration:
1. Download the GPU_LAB_UniStuttgart_SS2022 project from the github.
2. In the CMakeLists.txt change the boost include directory and boost library directory to system include folder.
      - set(BOOST_INC "C:/local/boost_1_76_0_b1_rc2")
      - set(BOOST_LIB "C:/local/boost_1_76_0_b1_rc2/lib64-msvc-14.2")

### Building the project
1.  Open Visual Studio-> Choose "Open a local folder" -> and select "GPU_LAB_UniStuttgart_SS2022" folder.
2.  CMake generation will automatically start.
3.  Build the project (Ctrl + Shift + B)
4.  In the solution explorer 
      - Choose "Switch between solutions and the available views"
      - Choose "CMake Targets View" 
      - Expand "DisparityMap Project"
      - Configure the "DisparityMap (executable)" as a startup item.

### Execution
1. Execution is started by clicking "DisparityMap.exe" play button.
2. Output is located in the <current project directory>/out/build/<build type>
     - Four pgm images are generated
        - "disparitymap_SAD_cpu.pgm" -> Generated by executing the disparity map algorithm(SAD) in cpu.
        - "disparitymap_SSD_cpu.pgm" -> Generated by executing the disparity map algorithm(SSD) in cpu.
        - "disparitymap_SAD_gpu.pgm" -> Generated by executing the disparity map algorithm(SAD) in gpu.
        - "disparitymap_SSD_cpu.pgm" -> Generated by executing the disparity map algorithm(SSD) in gpu.
